## Introduction

<justify>
In this project I was assigned to create a model that will predict the fuel consumption of a cruise ship base on data from several sensors. Data were provided in CSV files of raw sensor outputs. Units of fuel consumption are left open.

## Data processing

Each CSV file contains two columns: time and value. Time is in .NET DateTime.Ticks format and needs to be converted to human readable format in order to properly aggregate the data from all sensors.
